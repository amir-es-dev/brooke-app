          <p>
            I’ve gone through a number of phases in my career, and each of them
            has informed my current work ethos and philosophy. I have excelled
            in a number of project management roles in diverse industries, and
            believe that my number one asset is my ability to adapt to any
            challenge that is thrown my way.
